Tool: Matlab
 
**Design Aspects**

* Matlab code for NRZ-I encoding scheme will be implemented.

* Matlab code for MNRZ-I encoding scheme will be implemented.

* Then graph for NRZ-I and MNRZ-I will be plotted to show the differnce in between the two encoding.

* Then graph for comparision of average DC component between NRZ-I and MNRZ-I will be plotted to show the result of the reseach paper.
